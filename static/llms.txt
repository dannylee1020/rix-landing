# Rix

> AI search intelligence for beauty brands. Rix tracks how AI engines like ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google AI Overviews, and Claude recommend products, so beauty brands can understand and improve their AI visibility.

Rix monitors AI-generated responses for queries relevant to beauty products — skincare routines, ingredient searches, product comparisons, and "best of" lists. The platform tracks brand mentions, product recommendations, sentiment, and source citations across major AI engines.

## Core Capabilities

- **AI Visibility**: Track when and where AI mentions your brand, which SKUs get recommended, which retailers AI features, and the language AI uses to describe your products.
- **Competitive Intelligence**: Category and topic-level competition analysis, head-to-head comparisons, and share of voice for beauty queries.
- **Source Analytics**: See which publications AI trusts, full attribution for every recommendation, crawl coverage, and citation frequency analysis.

## Who It's For

Beauty brands selling skincare, makeup, haircare, or bodycare online — from $5M to $500M+ in revenue.
